</p>

## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.
Churn is a one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry. Research has shown that the average monthly churn rate among the top 4 wireless carriers in the US is 1.9% - 2%

Customer attrition is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. Customer churn otherwise known as customer attrition or customer turnover is the percentage of customers that stopped using your company's product or service within a specified timeframe. For instance, if you began the year with 500 customers but later ended with 480 customers, the percentage of customers that left would be 4%. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.

This solution will help this telecom company to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, a comprehensive investigation of the churn dataset was conducted to gain insights through various types of analyses.

- **Univariate analysis:** A thorough examination of each variable individually was performed. Summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles were calculated to understand the central tendency and spread of the data.

</p>

- **Bivariate analysis:** Relationships between pairs of variables were explored to identify patterns and potential predictor variables for sepsis classification.

</p>

- **Multivariate analysis:** Relationships among multiple variables were examined simultaneously, allowing for a deeper understanding of their interactions and impact on sepsis.

</p>

### Hypotheses:
These hypotheses, along with the results of the EDA, contribute to a deeper understanding of the dataset and provide valuable insights for further analysis and model development.

1. Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn than those with short tenure.
- Null: Customers with longer tenure are less likely to churn
- Alternative: Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Hypothesis1.png" alt="H1" width="600">
</p>
With the over all churn rate of 18.8%, Mid-term tenure contracts or subscriber turn to churn more than all other type of contracts. This is followed by medium-term tenures. Whiles the very short-term contract turn to churn the least. Further investigations needs to be conducted to obtain the right insight because earlier analysis showed that very short-term tenure had very small subscribers or users.

2. Customers with lesser income are likely to churn than those who have higher
- Null: Customer with less income are likely to churn
- Alternative: Customers with a bigger income are likely to churn
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Hypothesis2.png" alt="H2" width="600">
</p>

Based on the results, there is evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The difference in churn rates between the lower income group and the higher income group is statistically significant.

### Business Questions
1. What type of services offered by the telecom industry
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Q1.png" alt="Question1" width="600">
</p>
The bar chart presentated above indicates that voice related service has the greater share of the dataset. It is followed by data related service, with messaging subscribers been the least of the dataset. Expressor management must first conduct surveys and gather feedback loops to determine why users are patronizing one package than the other

2. What is the overall churn rate for the telecom company during the observed period?
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Q2.png" alt="Question2" width="600">
</p>
Based on the pie above it can be concluded that majority of the subscriber dont churn (81.2%). With the average churn rate of 18.8% of the subscribers. Even though the dataset is highly inbalanced, the churn rate is higher than the industry standard of 1.5-2%. Expressor management needs to urgently take measures to curtails this problem.

3. Are there any specific regions or geographic areas with a higher churn rate compared to others?
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Q3.png" alt="Question3" width="600">
</p>
The bar plot displays the average churn rates for all the regions.

From the graph, it can be seen that DAKAR is the only region with average churn rate greater than the overall churn rate.
SEDHIOU is the second highest in term of churn rate as has 5.4% of churn.
All the other regions are lower than the overall average churn rate.

4. What is the relationship between tunure and churn?
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Q4.png" alt="Question4" width="600">
</p>
Long term and very short term term tenures are the two tenures with their churn rate lower than the overall churn rate.
Medium term, Midterm and short term have churn rate above the overall churn rate.
This means that Medium to short term tenures turn to churn more
5. Are customers who have a higher number of on-net calls (ON_NET) less likely to churn?
<p align="center">
  <img src="images/Q5.png" alt="Question5" width="600">
</p>
The bar plot, put the on net call in to categories starting from 0-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400, 401-500 and infinally 500+ and calculates the the numbers of times they make calls in that range. The following are the observations made

201-300, had the majority of calls followed by 0-100
the other ranges had less than 2%

## Modeling

During the modeling phase, the evaluation of models took into consideration the imbalanced nature of the data. The best performance evaluation estimator would be the AUC score, which provide a balanced assessment for imbalanced datasets.

We trained the underlisted six models and evaluated their performance based on Area Under the Curve (AUC)

- **Logistic Regression** 
- **Decision Tree** 
- **Random Forest** 
- **GaussianNB**
- **ComplementNB**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

These models were evaluated based on their AUC and logloss scores, providing insights into their performance on the imbalanced dataset. 


Given the imbalanced nature of our dataset, we assessed the models' performance using the AUC metric.

- Logistic Regression model emerged as th top-performing model, achieving the highest AUC scores of 80%.
- ComplementNB consistently demonstrated high performance across different conditions.
- GaussianNB had a relatively lower AUC score and higher log loss compared to other models.


### Streamlit deployment
